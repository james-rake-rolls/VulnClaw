"""CLI shared data constants — extracted from cli/manual.py.

Moved here so that infrastructure-layer modules (e.g. skills/) can consume
CLI metadata without depending on the entry-layer cli/ package.

Modified by: Nyaecho
Modified: 2026-07-08
Reason: eliminate a V5 violation — skills/flag_skills.py depended back on cli/manual.py; the shared
         data constants were extracted into the config/ infrastructure package.
